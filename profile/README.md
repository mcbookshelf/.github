# About Bookshelf

Bookshelf is an organization dedicated to making Minecraft development easier, more efficient, and more collaborative. Our mission is to promote the use of libraries and share free resources to help mapmakers and datapackers build complex systems effortlessly.

## 🚀 Why Libraries?

Many developers rely on libraries to save time and improve efficiency, but in the Minecraft community, mapmakers often **reinvent the wheel** instead of reusing existing tools. We want to change that by encouraging the adoption of **modular, reusable solutions**.
